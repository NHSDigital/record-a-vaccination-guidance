Follow these steps or [watch our webinar](https://vimeo.com/1001103401) if your region has nominated you to invite providers to start using the Record a Vaccination Service (RAVS).

1. Log in to [www.ravs.england.nhs.uk](https://www.ravs.england.nhs.uk/) with your Okta account.

2. Search and select an organisation by its ODS code, name, address or postcode. This information is sourced from the [ODS (Organisation Data Service) portal](https://odsportal.digital.nhs.uk/), please email [exeter.helpdesk@nhs.net](mailto:exeter.helpdesk@nhs.net) if you have any issues.

3. Nominate a lead user responsible for adding other users. They’ll receive an email inviting them to use the service.

Lead users will be given ‘lead administrator’ permission levels.

## What happens next?

Once a lead user activates their account, they can start using the service.

## Viewing the status of the onboarded organisations

You can view all providers you’ve invited on the homepage. The ‘status’ will update from 'invited' to 'active' when the lead user logs into RAVS for the first time.

## Problems signing in?

If you cannot find your Okta activation email, check your junk. Or email [ravs.support@england.nhs.uk](ravs.support@england.nhs.uk) if it’s expired or you need help.

## Adding other users to the regional onboarding tool

To add another regional user, a nominated user must email [ravs.support@england.nhs.uk](ravs.support@england.nhs.uk) to request this.
