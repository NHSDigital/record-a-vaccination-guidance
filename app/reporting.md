Only lead administrators and administrators can create reports.

Vaccination data is available for extract as soon as it’s recorded and saved. You can extract data in a ‘.csv format’ (comma separated values) to support reporting within your organisation by choosing from a combination of:

* dates (up to a maximum of 31 days)
* vaccines
* sites

You can create reports as often as you like.

## Choosing vaccines

To support the Autumn Winter campaign, RAVS records the following 4 vaccines:

* COVID-19
* Flu
* Pertussis
* RSV

Select the vaccines you wish to report on.

## Running your reports

Depending on the volume of data you’ve selected, a screen may appear indicating that your report is being created.


### Downloading your report

When you download your report, it will appear in your browser downloads. Your browser should notify you when the extract is available.

**Important:** Downloaded extracts hold personal data. Handle them in line with your organisation’s data management policies.
