Vaccination data is available for extract as soon as it’s recorded and saved. You can extract data in a ‘.csv format’ (comma separated values) to support reporting within your organisation by choosing from a combination of:

* dates (up to a maximum of 2 weeks)
* vaccines
* sites

You aren’t restricted to how often or when you can create reports.

## Choosing dates

Select preset dates or a custom date range.

For custom reports, you must enter a past date range, up to a maximum of 2 weeks.

**Note:** The maximum 2 week restriction is temporary, and we’re looking to remove this soon.

* Flu

Select the vaccines you wish to report on.

## Running your reports

Depending on the volume of data you’ve selected, a screen may appear indicating that your report is being created.


### Downloading your report

When you download your report, it will appear in your browser downloads. Your browser should notify you when the extract is available.

**Important:** Downloaded extracts hold personal data. Handle them in line with your organisation’s data management policies.
