Only administrators and lead administrators can access this section to create reports.

Vaccination data is available for extract as soon as it's recorded and saved. You can extract data in a '.csv format' (comma separated values).

To create a report, select the 'Reports' link in the header.

You will then be asked to select what you want to report on, including the:

* timeframe (up to a maximum of 31 days)
* vaccines
* sites

You can create reports as often as you like.

### Downloading your report

When you download your report, it will appear in your browser downloads. Your browser should notify you when the extract is available.

**Important:** Downloaded extracts hold personal data. Handle them in line with your organisation's data management policies.
