## How to add vaccines

Select the 'Vaccines' link in the header. This will take you to the Vaccines home screen.

Then select 'Add vaccine' and follow the instructions on the next screens to:

- select the site where you want to add vaccines, if your organisation has multiple sites
- select the vaccine type and vaccine product
- enter the batch number and expiry date

When a batch has run out, you can mark it as depleted. This means you will no longer be able to select that batch when recording a vaccination.
