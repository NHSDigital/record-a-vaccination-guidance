Only lead administrators can manage vaccines and batches. 

## Adding batches 

Select ‘Add vaccine’ from the vaccines home screen. Then search and select a site’s name or ODS code and continue.

Select the ‘Vaccine type’ and ‘’Vaccine product you’d like to add to your chosen site and continue.

Enter a ‘Batch number’ and ‘Expiry date’. For COVID-19 batches, you must enter an extended field and a ‘Thawed expiry date’.

Before saving the vaccine batch, you can change or edit it from the final ‘Check and confirm’ screen by selecting a link. The link will return you to the relevant screen to make the necessary changes.

You’ll return to the ‘Vaccines’ home screen which shows the vaccines and active batches you’ve added to your sites.

## Editing, depleting and reactivating batches 

You can edit, deplete and reactive batches from the vaccine product screen.  

### What happens after I do this? 

* Edited batches will immediately change
* Depleted batches will immediately change to ‘Pending’ and become ‘Depleted’ at midnight
* Reactivated batches will immediately change to ‘Active’ on the vaccine product screen
