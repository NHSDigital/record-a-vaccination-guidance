Only lead administrators can manage vaccines and batches. 

## Adding batches 

Select ‘Add vaccine’ from the vaccines home screen. Then search and select a site’s name or ODS code and continue.

Enter a ‘Batch number’ and ‘Expiry date’. For COVID-19 batches, you must enter an extended field and a ‘Thawed expiry date’.

Before saving the vaccine batch, you can change or edit it from the final ‘Check and confirm’ screen by selecting a link. The link will return you to the relevant screen to make the necessary changes.

## Editing, depleting and reactivating batches 

You can edit, deplete and reactive batches from the vaccine product screen.  

### What happens after I do this? 

* Edited batches will immediately change
* Depleted batches will immediately change to ‘Pending’ and become ‘Depleted’ at midnight
* Reactivated batches will immediately change to ‘Active’ on the vaccine product screen
