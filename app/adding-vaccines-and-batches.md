Vaccines and batches must be added to the system so that users can choose from them when recording vaccinations.

Go to the vaccine home screen under ‘Settings’ to start.

## Adding vaccines

First, select the site(s) and then add the vaccine product(s). Your selections will move into a basket to review or amend before checking out.

Once you’ve confirmed your choices, save the added vaccine product(s) or continue adding vaccine batches.

## Adding batches

You must add vaccines before you can add batches.

Note: For COVID-19 batches, enter the batch number and thawed expiry date provided by your vaccine supplier. You can find this information on the vaccine vial box.

Once you’ve added a batch, it’s immediately activated for users to select when they are recording a vaccination.

## Expired and depleted batches

If you set a batch expiry or depletion date, it will remain active for users to select until midnight that day. It will then become inactive, and users cannot select it when they record new vaccinations.  

However, if a saved vaccination record needs to be edited, users can still select an expired or depleted batch if it was active at the time of the vaccination.
