Add vaccines and batches from the vaccine home screen under ‘Settings’.

## Adding vaccines

First, select the site(s) and then add the vaccine product(s). Your selections will move into a basket to review or amend before checking out.

Once you’ve confirmed your choices, save the added vaccine product(s) or continue adding vaccine batches.

## Adding batches

You must add vaccines before you can add batches.

Note: For COVID-19 batches, enter the batch number and thawed expiry date provided by your vaccine supplier. You can find this information on the vaccine vial box.

Once you’ve added a batch, it’s immediately activated for users to select.
