Here's what you need to do if your region has nominated you to invite providers to the Record a Vaccination Service (RAVS). 

Log in to www.ravs.england.nhs.uk with your Okta account to invite providers to use RAVS. 

Search and select an organisation by its ODS code, name, address or postcode. This information is sourced from the ODS portal, please contact their helpdesk if you have any issues.  

Nominate a lead user responsible for adding other users. They’ll receive an email inviting them to use the service. 

Lead users will be given ‘lead administrator’ permission levels. If you’d like to understand more, view managing users. 

What happens next? 

Once a lead user activates their account, they can start using the service.  

Viewing the status of the onboarded organisations 

You can view all providers you’ve invited on the homepage. The ‘status’ will update from 'invited' to 'active' when the lead user logs into RAVS for the first time. 

Problems signing in? 

If you cannot find your Okta activation email, please check your junk. Or contact our helpdesk if it’s expired or you need support.  

Adding other users to the regional onboarding tool 

If you need to add another regional user, a nominated user must contact our helpdesk to request this.
