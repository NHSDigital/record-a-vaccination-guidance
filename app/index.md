During the pilot phase, weâ€™ll use your feedback to test and improve the NHS Record a vaccination service (RAVS).

The service will be available at the same time as other point of care (POC) systems. But you only need to record data in RAVS.

The service only records data. You have control over clinical judgements or decisions

## Access training

Learn how to use the service with our  [training site](https://www.ravs-training.england.nhs.uk/). Once you log in, you can explore a demo of the service, which does not use real patient data.
