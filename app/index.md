The Record a vaccination service (RAVS) allows you to record COVID‑19, Flu, Pertussis and RSV patient and staff vaccinations.

The service only records data. You have control over clinical judgements or decisions.

### Data sent to GPs

Vaccinations recorded in RAVS from 1 September onwards will be visible in the GP record by 11 October.

If you record RSV and Pertussis vaccinations in RAVS, please do not send these records to GPs. This may create duplicate entries in the patient’s GP record.
