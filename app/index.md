During the pilot phase, weâ€™ll test and improve our service with the help of your feedback.

The service will be available at the same time as the [national immunisation and vaccination system (NIVS)](https://www.ardengemcsu.nhs.uk/services/business-intelligence/nivs/).

The NHS Record a vaccination service (RAVS) only records data. You have control over clinical judgements or decisions
