To log in to service, go to [NHS Record a vaccination](https://www.ravs.england.nhs.uk).

## Logging in for the first time

As soon as we create your RAVS account, you will receive an email with the subject line ‘Start using Record a vaccination’. 

RAVS uses Okta to sign users in securely. This means you also need an Okta account to log in to the service.

### Users who already have an Okta account

If you already have an okta account, you can log in to RAVS as soon as you’ve received the ‘Start using Record a vaccination’ email, using your Okta username and password. 

You’ll have the option to reset your Okta password if you need to.

You can also access the service directly through Okta by selecting ‘RAVS (PROD) app’.

### Users without an Okta account 

If you do not have an Okta account, we will create one for you at the same time as we create your RAVS account. 

You will get an email from Okta with the subject line ‘Welcome to Okta!’. 

This email includes an ‘Activate Okta Account’ link, which expires after 7 days. 

> [!NOTE]
> Activate your Okta account as soon as possible.

Once you’ve activated your Okta account, you will be able to log in to RAVS with your Okta credentials. 

#### Problems with Okta 

If you cannot find the email from Okta, check your spam or junk. 

If you’ve not activated your Okta account within 7 days  and the link in the email has expired, [contact us](/service-unavailable). 
 
## Problems logging in 
 
### Deactivated account 

Your RAVS account will be deactivated if you have not logged in to the service for 90 days. When an account is deactivated, you will receive an email telling you this has happened.  
 
If you still need access to RAVS, contact a lead administrator at your organisation who will be able to reactivate your account.  
 
If you are the only lead administrator at your organisation and you’ve been deactivated, contact your regional lead and ask them to add you to RAVS again.
