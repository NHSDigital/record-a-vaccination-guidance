To log in to service, go to the [https://www.ravs.england.nhs.uk](Record a vaccination home page).

## Logging in for the first time

As soon as we create your RAVS account, you will receive an email with the subject line ‘Start using Record a vaccination’. 

RAVS uses Okta to sign users in to RAVS securely. This means you also need an Okta account to log in to the service.

### Users who already have an Okta account

If you already have an okta account, you can log in to RAVS as soon as you’ve received the ‘Start using Record a vaccination’ email, using your Okta username and password. 

You’ll have the option to reset your Okta password if you need to.

You can also access the service directly through Okta by selecting ‘RAVS (PROD) app’.

### Users without an Okta account 

If you do not have an Okta account, we will create one for you at the same time as we create your RAVS account. 

You will get an email from Okta with the subject line ‘Welcome to Okta!’. 

This email includes an ‘Activate Okta Account’ link, which expires after 7 days. 

[use inset text to highlight this] Activate your Okta account as soon as possible.
