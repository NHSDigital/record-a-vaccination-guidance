Once you’ve found a patient and opened their record, you’ll see the patient details screen. You can check them in using their patient identifiers.
You can also review their previous COVID-19 and flu vaccinations in the history below.

If everything looks OK, continue to choose vaccines.

### Editing or deleting records within the vaccination history

You can only edit or delete vaccination records saved in RAVS. You cannot change records captured in other systems.

**Important**: Be cautious when deleting a vaccination record. Incorrectly doing so could impact the patient’s future care.

### Duplicate records

If a duplicate or similar record exists in PDS and RAVS, they will appear on the patient details screen. You can update the local record to reflect the PDS record.

### Adding vaccination records after they have been administered

**Important**: If you add vaccination records into RAVS after they have been administered, please check who gave the vaccine. For example, if another healthcare provider or setting administered it, RAVS will be recorded and displayed as the data source.
