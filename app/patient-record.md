Once you've found a patient and opened their record, you'll see their details and vaccination history.

If everything looks OK, continue to 'Choose vaccine'.

## Vaccination history

**You can view COVID-19, flu and RSV vaccinations in the history, unless the vaccine was recorded in the last 24 hours**. 

**You can only view pertussis vaccinations in the history if they were recorded in RAVS**. Pertussis vaccinations recorded in other systems (like point of care and GP systems) will not be shown.  

## Editing or deleting records within the vaccination history

You can only:

* edit or delete vaccination records saved in RAVS. You cannot change records captured in other systems.  
* edit the information recorded on the 'Vaccinate' screen. You cannot change the assessment or consent screen because it changes the vaccination outcome. 

**Important**: Be cautious when deleting a vaccination record. Incorrectly doing so could impact the patient's future care.
