Once you've found a patient and opened their record, you'll see their details and vaccination history.

If everything looks OK, continue to 'Choose vaccine'.

## Vaccination history

**You can view COVID-19, flu and RSV vaccinations in the history, unless the vaccine was recorded in the last 24 hours**. 

**You can only view pertussis vaccinations in the history if they were recorded in RAVS**. Pertussis vaccinations recorded in other systems (like point of care and GP systems) will not be shown.  

## Editing or deleting records within the vaccination history

You can only:

* edit or delete vaccination records saved in RAVS. You cannot change records captured in other systems.  
* edit the information recorded on the 'Vaccinate' screen. You cannot change the assessment or consent screen because it changes the vaccination outcome. 

**Important**: Be cautious when deleting a vaccination record. Incorrectly doing so could impact the patient's future care.

### Duplicate records

If a duplicate or similar record exists in PDS and RAVS, they will appear on the patient details screen. You can update the local record to reflect the PDS record.

### Adding vaccination records after they have been administered

**Important**: If you add vaccination records into RAVS after they have been administered, check who gave the vaccine. For example, if another healthcare provider or setting administered it, RAVS will be recorded and displayed as the data source.
