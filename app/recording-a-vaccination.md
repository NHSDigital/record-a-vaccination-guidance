There are several steps to record a vaccination.

## Choosing a vaccine

Select the vaccine and vaccine product you wish to give the patient.

If, for any reason, the patient is not ready for a vaccination, RAVS will notify you. The patient’s details and vaccination history inform the notification message.

## Assessing the patient

Check if the patient is suitable for the vaccination before continuing to capture consent.

To make recording vaccinations easier, there are a few things we’ve introduced or changed:

### Removed screening questions

Although you’ll continue to ask these questions to determine if a patient is suitable for vaccination, recording this information is no longer necessary.

### Selecting fields

You only need to select dates, clinical staff and vaccine batch details at the start of your session.

This information will remain the same until you make new selections during your session or log out. For example, if your staff or stock changes midway through a clinic.

### Exiting the journey

If you do not vaccinate the patient, you can save the journey and exit at this point.

This could be for the following reasons:

* patient declines
* it’s not appropriate to vaccinate the patient
* there’s a vaccine contraindication

## Recording consent

Before vaccinating the patient, you’ll need to capture their consent or the details of the person who is consenting on their behalf.

### Exiting the journey

If consent is refused, you can save and exit the journey at this stage.

This could be for the following reasons:

* patient has already had a vaccination
* patient has made a personal choice
* vaccine contains porcine

## Vaccinating the patient

Confirm the vaccination event details once you’ve given the patient the vaccine.

### Changing vaccines

If no batches are left in stock, you can switch the vaccine product at this point and search for an alternative batch to give to the patient.

Note: batches are assigned to a vaccine product and preadded to RAVS with an expiry date and dose volume. This means that when you select a batch, this information will prepopulate, saving you time.

## Checking and confirming

Before saving the patient’s vaccination record into RAVS, you can edit the record from the final check and confirm screen. The screen will return you to the relevant step to make the necessary changes.

Note: You cannot edit the patient’s demographic details.
