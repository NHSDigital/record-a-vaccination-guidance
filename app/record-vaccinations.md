We have introduced a quicker and simpler way to record vaccinations.

You can use this as an alternative to the existing **Find a patient** interface, which will remain available until 31 November 2025.

## What’s changed?

We have designed the new Record vaccinations interface to make it easier to select the most common options.

This means that you can more easily select:

* the vaccination date as being today
* yourself as the vaccinator
* that the patient gave their own consent
* left or right arm for the injection site

Once you’ve recorded the vaccination, you have the option to give record a different vaccination for the same patient (co-administration) or to record the same vaccination for another patient. This will avoid having to re-answer the same questions.

## Information no longer collected

Following a review, we no longer collect the following:

* assessment date
* assessing and consenting clinician
* legal mechanism

This information was never sent to GP records, and there is no national requirement to record this.

## Editing records

If you need to correct a vaccination record you previously recorded, this feature has moved to the new **Records** section.

You are now able to edit all of the fields except for date, vaccine and product.

It is not yet possible to delete a record from this section. If you need to delete a record you should do so from the **Find a patient** section.
