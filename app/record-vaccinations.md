From 1 October 2025, there will be a new simpler way to record vaccinations.
 
The new **Record vaccinations** section will be available alongside the existing **Find a patient** section until the end of November. In December, the **Find a patient** section will be removed.

## What you’ll be asked in the new journey 

When you record you first vaccination of the day or session, you’ll be asked the following in this order:

* Date of vaccination
* Site or team (only asked if your organisation has several sites)
* Name of the vaccinator
* Vaccine details
* Batch
* Eligibility (asked for all vaccinations except pertussis)
* Location type (only asked for COVID-19)
* Patient's NHS number or details 
 
At this point you will be shown the patient's details and vaccination history.  

You may then be shown a warning if your choice of vaccine product or the timing of the vaccine falls outside recommendations. But the warning will not prevent you from continuing with the vaccination. 

Next you'll be asked: 

* Patient's estimated due date (only asked for pertussis, and RSV if pregnant)
* Consent details
* Where on the body the vaccination was given (only asked for injected vaccines)
* If a full dose was given (only asked for Fluenz nasal spray) 
 
You'll then see a Check and confirm screen, where you can review your answers and save the vaccination record.  

### Recording the next vaccination 

Once the first vaccination you've recorded has been saved, you have 3 options for what you can do next. You can choose to either record: 

* another vaccination for the same patient (co-admin)
* the same vaccination for another patient
* a different vaccination for another patient  

If you choose either of the first 2 options, you’ll skip a number of questions as some of your previous answers will be saved. 

## What’s changed compared to the old journey

We’ve designed the new Record vaccinations journey to make it easier to select the most common answers. 

We’ve dropped a few questions compared to the old **Find a patient** recording journey. Because NHS England does not require these details to be recorded in RAVS, we no longer ask for: 

* Assessment date
* Legal mechanism
* Assessing clinician
* Assessment outcome
* Consenting clinician 
  
We’ve also made it easier and quicker to record another vaccination for the same patient, or to record the same vaccination for multiple patients.  
 
## Editing records

If you need to edit a vaccination record you previously recorded, this feature has moved to the new **Records** section.
