**Record vaccinations** is the new simpler way to record vaccinations. The existing [Find a patient](https://guide.ravs.england.nhs.uk/finding-a-patient/) section can still be used until 30 November 2025. You can use either option to record vaccinations.

## What you’ll be asked in Record vaccinations

When you record your first vaccination of the day or session, you’ll be asked the following, in this order:

* Date of vaccination
* Site or team (only asked if your organisation has several sites)
* Name of the vaccinator
* Vaccine details
* Batch
* Eligibility (asked for all vaccinations except pertussis)
* Location type (only asked for COVID-19)
* Patient's NHS number or details 
 
At this point you'll be shown the patient's details and vaccination history.  

You may also be shown a warning if your choice of vaccine product or the timing of the vaccine falls outside recommendations. But the warning will not prevent you from continuing with the vaccination. 

Next you'll be asked: 

* Patient's estimated due date (only asked for pertussis, and RSV if pregnant)
* Consent details
* Where on the body the vaccination was given (only asked for injected vaccines)
* If a full dose was given (only asked for Fluenz nasal spray) 
 
You'll then see a Check and confirm screen, where you can review your answers, add an optional note and save the vaccination record.  

### Recording the next vaccination 

We’ve made it easier and quicker to record several vaccinations for the same patient, or to record the same vaccination for multiple patients.  

Once the first vaccination you've recorded has been saved, you have 3 options for what you can do next. You can choose to either record: 

* another vaccination for the same patient (co-admin)
* the same vaccination for another patient
* a different vaccination for another patient  

If you choose either of the first 2 options, you’ll skip a number of questions as some of your previous answers will be saved. 

## What’s changed

We’ve designed **Record vaccinations** to make it easier to select the most common answers. 

We’ve removed the following questions because this information is not sent to NHS England or to GP records: 

* Assessment date
* Legal mechanism
* Assessing clinician
* Assessment outcome
* Consenting clinician 
  
## Editing records

If you need to edit a vaccination record you previously recorded, this feature has moved to the new [Records](https://guide.ravs.england.nhs.uk/records/) section.
