## How to record a vaccination

When you record your first vaccination of the day or the session, we ask for:

* Date of vaccination
* Site or team (only asked if your organisation has several sites)
* Name of the vaccinator (you will only see the names of users who've been added to RAVS as a 'vaccinator' by a lead administrator)
* Vaccine and batch details (if a vaccine or batch is not available to select, an administrator or lead administrator will need to add it the 'Vaccines' section of RAVS)
* Eligibility (asked for all vaccinations except pertussis)
* Location type (only asked for COVID-19)

### Patient details
You’ll then be asked for the patient’s NHS number so we can look up the patient’s details and vaccination history.  
 
If you do not have the patient’s NHS number, you can search for a patient using their name, date of birth and postcode.

#### Postcodes

You must use upper case letters and a space when you enter a postcode. For example, SW1A 2AA 

If the patient is homeless, you can try searching with the postcode ZZ99 3VZ. 

#### If no match is found

If no match is found for the details you enter, you have the option to record a vaccination without an NHS number.

### Vaccination history

Once the patient has been found, you’ll be shown their details and vaccination history. 

The vaccination history only shows some NHS vaccinations given in England. Currently it includes COVID-19, flu and RSV, plus some pertussis, pneumococcal and MMR records.  

### Warnings

You may see a warning if there is some important information to consider. For example, if the patient’s vaccination history suggests they are not due for a vaccination. But the warning will not prevent you from continuing. 

### The last few questions

Next you'll be asked:

* Patient's estimated due date (only asked for pertussis, and RSV if pregnant)
* Consent details
* Where on the body the vaccination was given (only asked for injected vaccines)
* If a full dose was given (only asked for Fluenz nasal spray)

### Saving a vaccination record

Before saving, uou'll see a Check and confirm page, where you can review your answers, add an optional note and save the vaccination record.

## Recording the next vaccination can be quicker

Once you’ve your first vaccination, you are presented with 3 options for what you can do next. You can either record:

* another vaccination for the same patient (co-admin)
* the same vaccination for another patient
* a different vaccination for another patient

If you choose either of the first 2 options, you’ll skip a number of questions as some of your previous answers will be saved.

### Another vaccination for the same patient (co-admin) 
This option saves the date, site or team, vaccinator and patient details from the previous vaccination you recorded.  

### Same vaccination for another patient 
This option can save the date, site or team, vaccinator, vaccine product, batch and eligibility from the previous vaccination you recorded. Before you start recording, you have the option to change some of the saved answers.  

### Different vaccination for another patient 
This option takes you back to the start of the full recording journey.  
 

## Editing and deleting records
