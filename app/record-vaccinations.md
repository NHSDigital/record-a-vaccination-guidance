## How to record a vaccination

When you record your first vaccination of the day or the session, we ask for:

* Date of vaccination
* Site or team (only asked if your organisation has several sites)
* Name of the vaccinator (you will only see the names of users who've been added to RAVS as a 'vaccinator' by a lead administrator)
* Vaccine and batch details (if a vaccine or batch is not available to select, an administrator or lead administrator will need to add it the 'Vaccines' section of RAVS)
* Eligibility (asked for all vaccinations except pertussis)
* Location type (only asked for COVID-19)
* Patient's NHS number or details

> [!NOTE]
> You must use upper case letters and a space when you enter a postcode. For example, SW1A 2AA.
>
> If the patient is homeless, you can try searching with the postcode ZZ99 3VZ.

As this point we look up the patient's details and vaccination history. 

If a match is found you’ll be shown the patient's details and vaccination history. 

If no match is found for the details entered, you have the option to record a vaccination without an NHS number.

You may also see a warning if there is some important information to consider. But the warning will not prevent you from continuing. 

Next you'll be asked:

* Patient's estimated due date (only asked for pertussis, and RSV if pregnant)
* Consent details
* Where on the body the vaccination was given (only asked for injected vaccines)
* If a full dose was given (only asked for Fluenz nasal spray)

### Saving a vaccination record

Before saving, you'll see a Check and confirm page, where you can review your answers and add an optional note.

### Recording the next vaccination 

Once you’ve recorded your first vaccination, you are presented with 3 options for what you can do next. You can either record:

* another vaccination for the same patient (co-admin)
* the same vaccination for another patient
* a different vaccination for another patient

If you choose either of the first 2 options, you’ll skip a number of questions as some of your previous answers will be saved.

### Another vaccination for the same patient (co-admin) 
This option saves the date, site or team, vaccinator and patient details from the previous vaccination you recorded.  

### Same vaccination for another patient 
This option allows you to save the date, site or team, vaccinator, vaccine product, batch and eligibility from the previous vaccination. Before you start recording, you have the option to change some of the saved answers.  

### Different vaccination for another patient 
This option takes you back to the start of the full recording journey.  
 

## Editing and deleting records
