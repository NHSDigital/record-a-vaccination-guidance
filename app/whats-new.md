### New contact details for support

### Changes to data shown on your home page

We've updated the home page you see once you've logged in to RAVS. 

- You can now see the number of vaccinations recorded by date, by vaccination type or by site (if your organisation has multiple sites).
- Select the tabs at the top of the table to switch between views.
- The totals are based on the date a vaccination was recorded, whereas previously they were based on the date a vaccination was given.
