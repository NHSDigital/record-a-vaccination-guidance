### New vaccinator role

- In Manage users, when you add a user, you are now asked if the user is a vaccinator. This replaces a previous question that asked if the user was a registered clinician. Any user previously added as a registered clinician will now appear as a vaccinator.
- In Record vaccinations, when you select a vaccinator, the list of names now includes users who have the role of vaccinator. Previously it included users with the role of registered clinician. If a vaccinator is missing from the list, make sure they are a vaccinator in Manage users.
- In Find a patient, when you select a vaccinator, the list of names now only includes users who have the role of vaccinator. Previously it included all users. If a vaccinator is missing from the list, make sure they are a vaccinator in Manage users.

### Search for vaccinators
In Record vaccinations, we now only display up to 16 names on the 'Who is the vaccinator?' page. If there are more than 16 vaccinators at an organisation, you can search for a name instead of scrolling down a long list.

### Reactivate multiple users in 1 go
In Manage users, there is now an option to reactivate all users who have been deactivated because they have not logged in for 90 days.

In Record vaccinations, you can now record a vaccination without an NHS number if no match is found when you search for the patient.
