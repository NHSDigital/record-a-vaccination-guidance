Find out about the latest changes to the Record a vaccination service.

## 26 November 2025: new vaccinator role
      
- In Manage users, when you add a user, you are now asked if the user is a vaccinator. This replaces a previous question that asked if the user was a registered clinician. Any user previously added as a registered clinician will now appear as a vaccinator.
- In Record vaccinations, when you select a vaccinator, the list of names now includes users who have the role of vaccinator. Previously it included users with the role of registered clinician. If a vaccinator is missing from the list, make sure they are a vaccinator in Manage users.
- In Find a patient, when you select a vaccinator, the list of names now only includes users who have the role of vaccinator. Previously it included all users. If a vaccinator is missing from the list, make sure they are a vaccinator in Manage users.
