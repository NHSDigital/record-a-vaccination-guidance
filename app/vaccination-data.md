## Do not send letters to GPs

On 11 October 24, we’ll automatically send RAVS RSV and Pertussis vaccination data to GPs.  

If you record RSV and Pertussis vaccinations in RAVS, please do not send these records to GPs. Sending these records may result in duplicate entries in the patient’s GP record.
