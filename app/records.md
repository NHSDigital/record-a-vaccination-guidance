All users can access this section, where you can edit or delete a vaccination record created by your organisation. 

## Finding a record

1. Search for the patient by NHS number, or by name, date of birth and postcode. 
2. You will then see the patient’s details and a list of their vaccination records.
4. Select ‘View’ next to the record you want to edit or delete. You will only see a 'View' link next to records created in RAVS by your organisation.

> [!NOTE]
> You must use upper case letters and a space when you enter a postcode. For example, SW1A 2AA.
>
> If the patient is homeless, you can try searching with the postcode ZZ99 3VZ.
