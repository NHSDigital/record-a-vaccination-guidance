All users can access the Records section, where you can view, edit or delete a vaccination record created by your organisation. 

## Finding a record

1. Search for the patient by NHS number.
2. You will then see the patient’s details and a list of their vaccination records.
3. Select ‘View’ next to the record you want to edit or delete. 

The ‘View’ link only appears next to records created by your organisation. This is because you can only edit or delete records created in RAVS by your organisation. 

## Editing a record

When you have found the vaccination record you want to edit, you’ll have the option of changing the following fields:  

* Batch
* Vaccinator
* Location type (only for COVID-19)
* Healthcare worker role (only for flu) 
* Consent details
* Injection site
* Dose (only for Fluenz nasal spray)
* Optional note

## Deleting a record

When you have found the record you want to delete, select the ‘Delete this record’ link at the bottom of the page and follow the instructions on screen.  

Once deleted, the record cannot be restored.
