From 1 October 2025, there will be a new **Records** section, where you can view and edit vaccination records created by your organisation.  

You'll be able to edit more fields than previously.  

It will not be possible initially to delete a record from this section. To delete a record, you will still need to go to the **Find a patient** section.
