**Records** is a new section, where you can view and edit vaccination records created by your organisation.  

## Video: Records

This short video shows the new section where you can edit records.

## What you can edit

More fields can be edited than previously. You'll be able to change any of the following:   

* Vaccinator
* Batch
* Location type (only applies to COVID-19)
* Consent details
* Injection site
* Full or half dose (only applies to Fluenz nasal spray)
* Optional note 

It will not be possible initially to delete a record from this section. To delete a record, you will still need to go to [Find a patient](https://guide.ravs.england.nhs.uk/finding-a-patient/).
