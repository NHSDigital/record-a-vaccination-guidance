On 1 October, we will be adding a new section called **Records**. 

You'll be able to view and edit vaccination records your organisation has created. 

Compared to the current edit journey, you'll be able to edit more fields. 

It will not be possible initially to delete a record from this section. To delete a record, you will still need to go to the **Find a patient** section.
