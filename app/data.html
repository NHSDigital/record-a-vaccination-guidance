Only lead administrators and administrators can create reports.

Vaccination data is available for extract as soon as it’s recorded and saved. You can extract data in a '.csv format' (comma separated values). 

To create a report, select the 'Reports' link in the header. 

You will then be asked to select what you want to report on, including the:

* timeframe (up to a maximum of 31 days) 
* vaccines 
* sites 

You can create reports as often as you like.

## Data sent to GPs

All vaccinations recorded in RAVS are visible in the patient’s GP record.

If you record RSV and pertussis vaccinations in RAVS, do not send these records to GPs. This may create duplicate entries in the patient’s GP record.
